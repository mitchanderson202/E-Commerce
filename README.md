# React e-Commerce-Shop Website

## Outline

Create a React E-Commerce website that reads data from Firebase Firestore. Minimal design, can be fixed in future. There's a Carousel on the Home page that shows the Favourite Products, then an All Products page which shows all products. There's also a single product page with size changes and a cart. This still needs a final touch up, but meets the requirements for now. The page is also fully responsive.

## Stack

- React
- SCSS
- Firebase-Firestore

## MVP

- Grid of products.
- Carousel of features products.
- Product page that allows you to add to cart and select a variation of the product (color, size, etc).
- Data from Firebase that shows: name, price, image url, favourited or not. All data is stored in Firestore and fetched, nothing to be stored in the react app.

## Updates to make

- I would like to make this page a better design. Design isn't my strong point but I can still do better.
- Make the Cart and sizes interactive and update a stock count.
- Add another product.
